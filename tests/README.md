This is a self study repo for Data Structures and Algorithms, based on the book by Loiane Groner: "Learning Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms" third edition. Jest automated test suites were built for each DS and Algorithm, and this code contains some minor improvements and tweaks to the code presented in the book.

I do have installed jest as a global dependency. In case Jest doesn't work after npm install, a manual installation must be done
